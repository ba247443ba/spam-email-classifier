# spam-email-classifier
Machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using NLP techniques.
<br>
This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.
The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction using NLP techniques, model training, and performance evaluation.
The goal is to create an accurate and reliable email spam detection system.


MNIST Digit Recognition Project

I built a machine learning model using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).
The project includes image preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation to achieve accurate digit classification.
This work helped me strengthen my understanding of computer vision, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques.
